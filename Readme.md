# Visual Analytics Layer for User Experiences

## VALUE is a low lightweight low-ceremony appraoch to creating data visualization user experiences.  It abstracts the details of the data storage layer so that viualizations and user experienes can work with any data source without having to understand the nuances of each one.  For example a heatmap visualization could work on relational data, a document database or a REST API.  The back end interface would be responsible for performant data aggregation.
